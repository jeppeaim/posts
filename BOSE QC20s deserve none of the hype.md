_(Sorry in advance, bc I have a lot to say on this subject lol, it's hard to be concise.)_

I get pretty heated towards the end just thinking about how bad the QC20s are lol.

### Why are BOSE QC20s the In-Ears of choice for competitive PUBG players?
It has to be the noise cancelling. I used the QC20's for a while just to see what the hype was about, the sound quality was terrible, in terms of [frequency response](https://www.rtings.com/headphones/1-5/graph#236/7917), but also depth (how far or close sounds are) and width (left/right placement of shots and steps) The noise cancelling is the only thing the QC20s bring to the table, but it's not like they noise cancel better than any other noise-cancelling headphone.
### But does gear matter?
Something to consider is that, clearly, since a ton of pros are using the QC20s and playing at a pro level, it only matters so much. You can get used to the QC20s and once you do you can play well. I was able to get used to them, I still wouldn't recommend it though. It's sort of like stockholm syndrome. As both an avid gamer and a professional audio engineer, I would never work with audio on the QC20s. So for me personally, having to switch back and forth between two headsets gets extremely annoying after a while. And since I had headphones that sounded better, I didn't have to. And I *know* for a fact that there are headphones that outperform the QC20s, some for less money.

What I would recommend is some kind of noise-cancelling headphones, the benefits of noise cancelling can't be overstated even if you live in a relatively quiet place. Unfortunately I haven't had the oppurtunity to try a whole bunch, but I have tried Skullcandy Venues (which are overears, just as good as the bose if not better, for at least $100 less) and Bose's Quietcomfort (35s I think) are actually really good, I've wanted them for a long time. I've also heard, pretty unanimously, that Sony's WHX have better noise cancelling and quality than the quietcomforts. Though I haven't been able to verify that yet. 
### The one benefit of QC20s, and the shortcomings of my knowledge
There is however, one thing about the QC20s that makes them a contender for competitive gaming, a very *weak* contender, but a contender nonetheless and that is the fact that they are in-ears, and not over-ears or on-ears. This means that they can be used at LAN because an extra pair of noise cancelling on-ears can be put over the QC20s (these are provided by the LAN organizer or w.e,). I've heard (and find it reasonable) that over-ears are allowed at some LANs, but in-ears will probably always be alowed, I can't think of a situation where they would ban in-ears but not over-ears. And because in-ears will always be aloud, it only makes sense to also use them outside of a LAN so that you don't have to adjust your ears every time you go to LAN. 

Anyway this is where my knowledge falls short, I don't know of any other noise-cancelling *in-ear* headphones because I've never looked them up, I don't want any lol. But I guarantee you there are better ones out there. I am going to research this eventually, it's just low on my list of priorities at the moment. 

BUT in the mean time, here's a reddit list of ANC In-Ears that I have glanced at, it seems aight https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jejfnc/active_noise_cancelling_headphones_buyers_guide/

I do however have plenty of knowledge about over-ear headphones:

### Don't give a shit about money or background noise?
**Sennheiser HD650** - $300-400

**Sennheiser HD800** - $800
### Budget options
**Takstar Pro 82s** - $60-80 (Upgraded HyperX Cloud IIs, minus the mic. Straight up would audio engineer and record with these as well, and they're *sooo* comfy)
### Noise cancelling Over-Ears

**Skullcandy Venues** - $100-200

**Sony WHX** - $200-300

**Bose QuietComfort** - $200-300

## Pro's and cons of QC20s
### The Cons (First, because THEY'RE REALLY BAD)
- Sound like absolute shit
	- out of the $250 dollars you're spending, it sounds like about $20 dollars went into the sound
		- and probably about $100 towards nothing really, just because BOSE somehow became a prestigious name
- Feel like absolute shit because they are constantly inside of your ear canal
- build quality? (a small piece broke off of my left earphone and now the rubber tip doesn't stay on)
- The noise cancelling (because it isn't anything special, at all, in any way shape or form)

### The Pros (wracking my brain here)
- They can be used at LAN (again, nothing special here really)
- They have the name BOSE on them(?)
- You're spending a lot of money on them, so you can like, feel cool about that I guess (??)

Y'all know that the rest of BOSE's products are geared towards like, Florida retirees who wear hawaiian shirts while listening to "cheeseburger in paradise", right? (Right???)
